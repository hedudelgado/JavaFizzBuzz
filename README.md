The Game.
=========
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "Fizz", any number divisible by five with the word "Buzz", any number divisible by both "FizzBuzz" and any other number, keep the number itself.
